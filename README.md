TF2 powered by AI

We are developing cutting-edge, super-advanced Artificial Intelligence to enhance TF2 server performance.

Current Todo Tasks:

• Level 0:  
  - Create a script to place directories and files correctly in the TF2 source code.

• Level 1:  
  - Develop a VScript named "CrateBots" to create bots.  
  - Create a VScript called "ExtractDataFromBots" to extract data from bots and send it to a Python script.  
  - Write a Python script to receive the data and perform necessary modifications.  
  - Implement a VScript "ReceiveData" to receive data from the I/O script and apply changes to bots.  
  - Design a proper test map using the Hammer Map Editor.
